# Discord

We manage a Discord community to share resources from events, announcements,
and discuss JavaScript and web development topics. Join to network and keep the
conversations going outside the scheduled events.

## But What Happened to the Slack Team!?

Discord is in, Slack is out.
We created the Discord server in August 2022, replacing the Slack team we've
managed since January 2016.
