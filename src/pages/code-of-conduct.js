      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScriptMN is an organization dedicated to building an inclusive local
        technology community in Minnesota, and to grassroots sharing of
        technical knowledge on the JavaScript programming language and related
        technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To support that mission, JavaScriptMN has adopted a Code of Conduct to
        ensure that all members of our community are treated with the respect
        they deserve. Every JavaScriptMN member, presenter, attendee, vendor,
        and sponsor will be held to this standard.
      </p>

      <div className="sub-section">
        <h2>JavaScriptMN Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          All JavaScriptMN members, presenters, attendees, sponsors, or business
          partners are expected to be respectful of one another at all times.
          All forms of harassment, particularly harassment related to gender,
          sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, or physical
          appearance, will not be tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should a JavaScriptMN member engage in harassing activities, they will
          be removed from the group. If harassment happens at a
          JavaScriptMN-sponsored event, the harassing party will be asked to
          leave the event. No refund will be given if any fee was collected. Any
          person engaged in harassing behavior online will be removed from the
          group. Any vendor or sponsor engaging in harassing activities will not
          be allowed to sponsor or receive funds from JavaScriptMN in the
          future.
